      <font id="hig" size="5">High Contrast Mode and Chrome</font>
      <br><br>
      What is High Contrast Mode in Chrome? High Contrast Mode refers to settings that a user is able to toggle between
      to set the contrast of their screen in the way that is most comfortable for their use. In the Chrome browser this
      can be achieved by using an extension called High Contrast.

      <br><br>
      What is the purpose of this test? To ensure that a website's contents respond well to the preferences set by the
      user in High Contrast, regardless of the settings chosen, and that the contents are fully visible and
      interactable.

      <br><br>
      <font id="col" size="5">Color contrast</font>
      <br><br>
      What is a Contrast Checker? A tool automatically calculates the contrast between two cores according to the Web
      Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

      <br><br>
      What is the purpose of this test? The principle of contrast is very important in the composition and harmonization
      of colors that helps with legibility, reading, in addition to invoking sensory aspects, the problem is that not
      all people perceive color in the same way
      <br>
      It is necessary to provide sufficient color contrast between background and foreground content to better support
      users with low vision or color blindness in understanding the information on the screen.
      <br>
      Higher contrast ratios are beneficial to all users. Make sure that the contrast between the colors is according to
      the WCAG standard and that the user can navigate the flow without hindrance.
      <br><br>

      <font id="cap" size="5">CAPTCHAs</font>
      <br><br>
      What is captcha? CAPTCHA = A challenge-response test used to determine whether a user is a human or a bot. Most
      notable example is the barely-legible, distorted, or “fuzzy” alphanumeric codes a user must correctly copy before
      submitting a form, or sometimes confirming which pictures in a grid contain a specific object, or solving a basic
      arithmetic problem.
      <br><br>
      <!--  <img src="media/img1.jpg"> -->
      <br><br>
      What is this testing goal? We need to ensure someone using assistive technology will also be able to complete the
      user flow, even If CAPTCHAs or other tests are used.

      <br><br>
      <!-- <img src="media/img2.jpg"> -->
      <br><br>
      When testing captchas, we want to be sure that:
      <br>
      there are sensory alternatives to this (if it’s image challenge, there’s also an audio option to be
      reproduced);<br>
      Users using assistive technologies like a screen reader are able to find and operate the captcha’s controls.

      <br><br>
      <font id="swi" size="5">Switch access</font>
      <br><br>
      What is Switch Access? Switch Access is a assistive device that helps people with cognitive difficulties,
      developmental delays and physical limitations. It needs to connect to your devices as desktop, notebook and phones
      to replace the functionality of a keyboard or mouse.

      <br><br>
      All people need independence in their daily lives. People with mobility limitations had some limitations in their
      daily lives. Using the switch access can resignify the freedom of being able to work and have your life the way
      the user wants.
